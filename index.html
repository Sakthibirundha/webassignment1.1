<p>My hobby is reading short story .Once such is,An old man lived in the village.He was one of the most unfortunate people in the world.The whole 
village was tired of him;he was always gloomy,he constantly complained and was always in a bad mood
The longer he lived,the more bile he was becoming and the more poisonous were
his words.People  avoided him,because his misfortune became contagious.
It was even unnatural and insulting to be happy next to him.
He created the feeling of unhappiness in others.
But one day,when he turned eighty years old ,an incredible thing happened.Instantly everyone started 
hearing the rumour"An old man is happy today,he doesn'tabindexcomplain about anything
smiles,and even his face is freshened up."
The whole village gathered .they ased what happened to you?
"nothing special.eighty years i've been chasing happiness,and it was useless.And then
I decided to live without happiness and just enjoy life.That's why I'm happy now."-OLD MAN
